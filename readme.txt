When you open the program, you will see a text that is helping you to choose the one option that you need. You will have to enter a number from 0 to 6 where every number means:

0 - exit;

1 - print all jokes to the screen;

2 - print a random joke to the screen;

3 - print a joke that you want to the screen. There you will also have to enter another number - the number of the joke. All their numbers you can see by printing all jokes;

4 - the mix - one random question and one random answer;

5 - print all jokes to a file. There you will have to enter a full name of file - name of file and the file type - the recommended one is '.txt'.

6 - write a new joke. At first, you will get a command which will tell to write a question and enter it. Later you will get a command to enter an answer. After this, your joke will be saved contemporary. Your joke will not be saved if you use inappropriate jokes. It will be saved into a file for a lifetime when you close the program. So be sure to close the program properly by entering a 0.

Also, when you enter a 0 - you will have an option to save changes. To do so you have to enter Y or y. To exit without saving you can type any letter.
